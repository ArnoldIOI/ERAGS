My goal here is to figure out what the best essay would be like.\n\nIt would be well-written, but you can write well about any topic. What made it special would be what it was about.\n\nObviously some topics would be better than others. It probably wouldn't be about this year's lipstick colors. But it wouldn't be vaporous talk about elevated themes either. A good essay has to be surprising. It has to tell people something they don't already know.\n\nThe best essay would be on the most important topic you could tell people something surprising about.\n\nThat may sound obvious, but it has some unexpected consequences. One is that science enters the picture like an elephant stepping into a rowboat. For example, Darwin first described the idea of natural selection in an essay written in 1844. Talk about an important topic you could tell people something surprising about. If that's the test of a great essay, this was surely the best one written in 1844. And indeed, the best possible essay at any given time would usually be one describing the most important scientific or technological discovery it was possible to make. [1]\n\nAnother unexpected consequence: I imagined when I started writing this that the best essay would be fairly timeless \u2014 that the best essay you could write in 1844 would be much the same as the best one you could write now. But in fact the opposite seems to be true. It might be true that the best painting would be timeless in this sense. But it wouldn't be impressive to write an essay introducing natural selection now. The best essay now would be one describing a great discovery we didn't yet know about.\n\nIf the question of how to write the best possible essay reduces to the question of how to make great discoveries, then I started with the wrong question. Perhaps what this exercise shows is that we shouldn't waste our time writing essays but instead focus on making discoveries in some specific domain. But I'm interested in essays and what can be done with them, so I want to see if there's some other question I could have asked.\n\nThere is, and on the face of it, it seems almost identical to the one I started with. Instead of asking what would the best essay be? I should have asked how do you write essays well? Though these seem only phrasing apart, their answers diverge. The answer to the first question, as we've seen, isn't really about essay writing. The second question forces it to be.\n\nWriting essays, at its best, is a way of discovering ideas. How do you do that well? How do you discover by writing?\n\nAn essay should ordinarily start with what I'm going to call a question, though I mean this in a very general sense: it doesn't have to be a question grammatically, just something that acts like one in the sense that it spurs some response.\n\nHow do you get this initial question? It probably won't work to choose some important-sounding topic at random and go at it. Professional traders won't even trade unless they have what they call an edge \u2014 a convincing story about why in some class of trades they'll win more than they lose. Similarly, you shouldn't attack a topic unless you have a way in \u2014 some new insight about it or way of approaching it.\n\nYou don't need to have a complete thesis; you just need some kind of gap you can explore. In fact, merely having questions about something other people take for granted can be edge enough.\n\nIf you come across a question that's sufficiently puzzling, it could be worth exploring even if it doesn't seem very momentous. Many an important discovery has been made by pulling on a thread that seemed insignificant at first. How can they all be finches? [2]\n\nOnce you've got a question, then what? You start thinking out loud about it. Not literally out loud, but you commit to a specific string of words in response, as you would if you were talking. This initial response is usually mistaken or incomplete. Writing converts your ideas from vague to bad. But that's a step forward, because once you can see the brokenness, you can fix it.\n\nPerhaps beginning writers are alarmed at the thought of starting with something mistaken or incomplete, but you shouldn't be, because this is why essay writing works. Forcing yourself to commit to some specific string of words gives you a starting point, and if it's wrong, you'll see that when you reread it.

Forcing yourself to commit to some specific string of words gives you a starting point, and if it's wrong, you'll see that when you reread it. At least half of essay writing is rereading what you've written and asking is this correct and complete? You have to be very strict when rereading, not just because you want to keep yourself honest, but because a gap between your response and the truth is often a sign of new ideas to be discovered.\n\nThe prize for being strict with what you've written is not just refinement. When you take a roughly correct answer and try to make it exactly right, sometimes you find that you can't, and that the reason is that you were depending on a false assumption. And when you discard it, the answer turns out to be completely different. [3]\n\nIdeally the response to a question is two things: the first step in a process that converges on the truth, and a source of additional questions (in my very general sense of the word). So the process continues recursively, as response spurs response. [4]\n\nUsually there are several possible responses to a question, which means you're traversing a tree. But essays are linear, not tree-shaped, which means you have to choose one branch to follow at each point. How do you choose? Usually you should follow whichever offers the greatest combination of generality and novelty. I don't consciously rank branches this way; I just follow whichever seems most exciting; but generality and novelty are what make a branch exciting. [5]\n\nIf you're willing to do a lot of rewriting, you don't have to guess right. You can follow a branch and see how it turns out, and if it isn't good enough, cut it and backtrack. I do this all the time. In this essay I've already cut a 17-paragraph subtree, in addition to countless shorter ones. Maybe I'll reattach it at the end, or boil it down to a footnote, or spin it off as its own essay; we'll see. [6]\n\nIn general you want to be quick to cut. One of the most dangerous temptations in writing (and in software and painting) is to keep something that isn't right, just because it contains a few good bits or cost you a lot of effort.\n\nThe most surprising new question being thrown off at this point is does it really matter what the initial question is? If the space of ideas is highly connected, it shouldn't, because you should be able to get from any question to the most valuable ones in a few hops. And we see evidence that it's highly connected in the way, for example, that people who are obsessed with some topic can turn any conversation toward it. But that only works if you know where you want to go, and you don't in an essay. That's the whole point. You don't want to be the obsessive conversationalist, or all your essays will be about the same thing. [7]\n\nThe other reason the initial question matters is that you usually feel somewhat obliged to stick to it. I don't think about this when I decide which branch to follow. I just follow novelty and generality. Sticking to the question is enforced later, when I notice I've wandered too far and have to backtrack. But I think this is the optimal solution. You don't want the hunt for novelty and generality to be constrained in the moment. Go with it and see what you get. [8]\n\nSince the initial question does constrain you, in the best case it sets an upper bound on the quality of essay you'll write. If you do as well as you possibly can on the chain of thoughts that follow from the initial question, the initial question itself is the only place where there's room for variation.\n\nIt would be a mistake to let this make you too conservative though, because you can't predict where a question will lead. Not if you're doing things right, because doing things right means making discoveries, and by definition you can't predict those.", "start_char_idx": 3712, "end_char_idx": 8106, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "adb44d1d-294e-43c6-81a5-fd941af495cb": {"__data__": {"id_": "adb44d1d-294e-43c6-81a5-fd941af495cb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/arnold/Documents/ThesisProject/ERAGS/scripts/../data/knowledge_base/best.txt", "file_name": "best.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 24485, "creation_date": "2024-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2f9e98e0-e8dd-47e9-9f3e-0c27fa5090ed", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/arnold/Documents/ThesisProject/ERAGS/scripts/../data/knowledge_base/best.txt", "file_name": "best.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 24485, "creation_date": "2024-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-11"}, "hash": "ddbdb628ea9b1e275106fe8a6f71973a3de81384d0917207a634ed5c7701157a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5a44dc1c-f124-423a-80b0-48b3ef96d448", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/arnold/Documents/ThesisProject/ERAGS/scripts/../data/knowledge_base/best.txt", "file_name": "best.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 24485, "creation_date": "2024-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-11"}, "hash": "3cfb537e9fbb8ed5520ee03573e878a001573e45d593d34f0d56e6acfb778ae2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9dfb7d82-d65d-4f6a-8666-2b12f42747f4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "5cfa49a0a16c890e37648545cbea6ce31e1d2f9a65ebcc48a6724d0a2cc3f4d6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "I just follow novelty and generality.

If you do as well as you possibly can on the chain of thoughts that follow from the initial question, the initial question itself is the only place where there's room for variation.\n\nIt would be a mistake to let this make you too conservative though, because you can't predict where a question will lead. Not if you're doing things right, because doing things right means making discoveries, and by definition you can't predict those. So the way to respond to this situation is not to be cautious about which initial question you choose, but to write a lot of essays. Essays are for taking risks.\n\nAlmost any question can get you a good essay. Indeed, it took some effort to think of a sufficiently unpromising topic in the third paragraph, because any essayist's first impulse on hearing that the best essay couldn't be about x would be to try to write it. But if most questions yield good essays, only some yield great ones.\n\nCan we predict which questions will yield great essays? Considering how long I've been writing essays, it's alarming how novel that question feels.\n\nOne thing I like in an initial question is outrageousness. I love questions that seem naughty in some way \u2014 for example, by seeming counterintuitive or overambitious or heterodox. Ideally all three. This essay is an example. Writing about the best essay implies there is such a thing, which pseudo-intellectuals will dismiss as reductive, though it follows necessarily from the possibility of one essay being better than another. And thinking about how to do something so ambitious is close enough to doing it that it holds your attention.\n\nI like to start an essay with a gleam in my eye. This could be just a taste of mine, but there's one aspect of it that probably isn't: to write a really good essay on some topic, you have to be interested in it. A good writer can write well about anything, but to stretch for the novel insights that are the raison d'etre of the essay, you have to care.\n\nIf caring about it is one of the criteria for a good initial question, then the optimal question varies from person to person. It also means you're more likely to write great essays if you care about a lot of different things. The more curious you are, the greater the probable overlap between the set of things you're curious about and the set of topics that yield great essays.\n\nWhat other qualities would a great initial question have? It's probably good if it has implications in a lot of different areas. And I find it's a good sign if it's one that people think has already been thoroughly explored. But the truth is that I've barely thought about how to choose initial questions, because I rarely do it. I rarely choose what to write about; I just start thinking about something, and sometimes it turns into an essay.\n\nAm I going to stop writing essays about whatever I happen to be thinking about and instead start working my way through some systematically generated list of topics? That doesn't sound like much fun. And yet I want to write good essays, and if the initial question matters, I should care about it.\n\nPerhaps the answer is to go one step earlier: to write about whatever pops into your head, but try to ensure that what pops into your head is good. Indeed, now that I think about it, this has to be the answer, because a mere list of topics wouldn't be any use if you didn't have edge with any of them. To start writing an essay, you need a topic plus some initial insight about it, and you can't generate those systematically. If only. [9]\n\nYou can probably cause yourself to have more of them, though.

To start writing an essay, you need a topic plus some initial insight about it, and you can't generate those systematically. If only. [9]\n\nYou can probably cause yourself to have more of them, though. The quality of the ideas that come out of your head depends on what goes in, and you can improve that in two dimensions, breadth and depth.\n\nYou can't learn everything, so getting breadth implies learning about topics that are very different from one another. When I tell people about my book-buying trips to Hay and they ask what I buy books about, I usually feel a bit sheepish answering, because the topics seem like a laundry list of unrelated subjects. But perhaps that's actually optimal in this business.\n\nYou can also get ideas by talking to people, by doing and building things, and by going places and seeing things. I don't think it's important to talk to new people so much as the sort of people who make you have new ideas. I get more new ideas after talking for an afternoon with Robert Morris than from talking to 20 new smart people. I know because that's what a block of office hours at Y Combinator consists of.\n\nWhile breadth comes from reading and talking and seeing, depth comes from doing. The way to really learn about some domain is to have to solve problems in it. Though this could take the form of writing, I suspect that to be a good essayist you also have to do, or have done, some other kind of work. That may not be true for most other fields, but essay writing is different. You could spend half your time working on something else and be net ahead, so long as it was hard.\n\nI'm not proposing that as a recipe so much as an encouragement to those already doing it. If you've spent all your life so far working on other things, you're already halfway there. Though of course to be good at writing you have to like it, and if you like writing you'd probably have spent at least some time doing it.\n\nEverything I've said about initial questions applies also to the questions you encounter in writing the essay. They're the same thing; every subtree of an essay is usually a shorter essay, just as every subtree of a Calder mobile is a smaller mobile. So any technique that gets you good initial questions also gets you good whole essays.\n\nAt some point the cycle of question and response reaches what feels like a natural end. Which is a little suspicious; shouldn't every answer suggest more questions? I think what happens is that you start to feel sated. Once you've covered enough interesting ground, you start to lose your appetite for new questions. Which is just as well, because the reader is probably feeling sated too. And it's not lazy to stop asking questions, because you could instead be asking the initial question of a new essay.\n\nThat's the ultimate source of drag on the connectedness of ideas: the discoveries you make along the way. If you discover enough starting from question A, you'll never make it to question B. Though if you keep writing essays you'll gradually fix this problem by burning off such discoveries. So bizarrely enough, writing lots of essays makes it as if the space of ideas were more highly connected.\n\nWhen a subtree comes to an end, you can do one of two things. You can either stop, or pull the Cubist trick of laying separate subtrees end to end by returning to a question you skipped earlier. Usually it requires some sleight of hand to make the essay flow continuously at this point, but not this time. This time I actually need an example of the phenomenon. For example, we discovered earlier that the best possible essay wouldn't usually be timeless in the way the best painting would. This seems surprising enough to be worth investigating further.\n\nThere are two senses in which an essay can be timeless: to be about a matter of permanent importance, and always to have the same effect on readers. With art these two senses blend together. Art that looked beautiful to the ancient Greeks still looks beautiful to us. But with essays the two senses diverge, because essays teach, and you can't teach people something they already know.

For example, we discovered earlier that the best possible essay wouldn't usually be timeless in the way the best painting would. This seems surprising enough to be worth investigating further.\n\nThere are two senses in which an essay can be timeless: to be about a matter of permanent importance, and always to have the same effect on readers. With art these two senses blend together. Art that looked beautiful to the ancient Greeks still looks beautiful to us. But with essays the two senses diverge, because essays teach, and you can't teach people something they already know. Natural selection is certainly a matter of permanent importance, but an essay explaining it couldn't have the same effect on us that it would have had on Darwin's contemporaries, precisely because his ideas were so successful that everyone already knows about them. [10]\n\nI imagined when I started writing this that the best possible essay would be timeless in the stricter, evergreen sense: that it would contain some deep, timeless wisdom that would appeal equally to Aristotle and Feynman. That doesn't seem to be true. But if the best possible essay wouldn't usually be timeless in this stricter sense, what would it take to write essays that were?\n\nThe answer to that turns out to be very strange: to be the evergreen kind of timeless, an essay has to be ineffective, in the sense that its discoveries aren't assimilated into our shared culture. Otherwise there will be nothing new in it for the second generation of readers. If you want to surprise readers not just now but in the future as well, you have to write essays that won't stick \u2014 essays that, no matter how good they are, won't become part of what people in the future learn before they read them. [11]\n\nI can imagine several ways to do that. One would be to write about things people never learn. For example, it's a long-established pattern for ambitious people to chase after various types of prizes, and only later, perhaps too late, to realize that some of them weren't worth as much as they thought. If you write about that, you can be confident of a conveyor belt of future readers to be surprised by it.\n\nDitto if you write about the tendency of the inexperienced to overdo things \u2014 of young engineers to produce overcomplicated solutions, for example. There are some kinds of mistakes people never learn to avoid except by making them. Any of those should be a timeless topic.\n\nSometimes when we're slow to grasp things it's not just because we're obtuse or in denial but because we've been deliberately lied to. There are a lot of things adults lie to kids about, and when you reach adulthood, they don't take you aside and hand you a list of them. They don't remember which lies they told you, and most were implicit anyway. So contradicting such lies will be a source of surprises for as long as adults keep telling them.\n\nSometimes it's systems that lie to you. For example, the educational systems in most countries train you to win by hacking the test. But that's not how you win at the most important real-world tests, and after decades of training, this is hard for new arrivals in the real world to grasp. Helping them overcome such institutional lies will work as long as the institutions remain broken. [12]\n\nAnother recipe for timelessness is to write about things readers already know, but in much more detail than can be transmitted culturally. \"Everyone knows,\" for example, that it can be rewarding to have kids. But till you have them you don't know precisely what forms that takes, and even then much of what you know you may never have put into words.\n\nI've written about all these kinds of topics. But I didn't do it in a deliberate attempt to write essays that were timeless in the stricter sense. And indeed, the fact that this depends on one's ideas not sticking suggests that it's not worth making a deliberate attempt to. You should write about topics of timeless importance, yes, but if you do such a good job that your conclusions stick and future generations find your essay obvious instead of novel, so much the better. You've crossed into Darwin territory.\n\nWriting about topics of timeless importance is an instance of something even more general, though: breadth of applicability. And there are more kinds of breadth than chronological \u2014 applying to lots of different fields, for example. So breadth is the ultimate aim.\n\nI already aim for it. Breadth and novelty are the two things I'm always chasing. But I'm glad I understand where timelessness fits.\n\nI understand better where a lot of things fit now.

But when you step back and ask what's the best you can do short of making some great discovery like that, the answer turns out to be about procedure.

But you get into all sorts of difficulties if you want to disqualify essays on this account. How do you decide where the cutoff should be? If a virus kills off everyone except a handful of people sequestered at Los Alamos, could an essay that had been disqualified now be eligible? Etc.\n\nDarwin's 1844 essay was derived from an earlier version written in 1839. Extracts from it were published in 1858.\n\n[2] When you find yourself very curious about an apparently minor question, that's an exciting sign. Evolution has designed you to pay attention to things that matter. So when you're very curious about something random, that could mean you've unconsciously noticed it's less random than it seems.\n\n[3] Corollary: If you're not intellectually honest, your writing won't just be biased, but also boring, because you'll miss all the ideas you'd have discovered if you pushed for the truth.\n\n[4] Sometimes this process begins before you start writing. Sometimes you've already figured out the first few things you want to say. Schoolchildren are often taught they should decide everything they want to say, and write this down as an outline before they start writing the essay itself. Maybe that's a good way to get them started \u2014 or not, I don't know \u2014 but it's antithetical to the spirit of essay writing. The more detailed your outline, the less your ideas can benefit from the sort of discovery that essays are for.\n\n[5] The problem with this type of \"greedy\" algorithm is that you can end up on a local maximum. If the most valuable question is preceded by a boring one, you'll overlook it. But I can't imagine a better strategy. There's no lookahead except by writing. So use a greedy algorithm and a lot of time.\n\n[6] I ended up reattaching the first 5 of the 17 paragraphs, and discarding the rest.\n\n[7] Stephen Fry confessed to making use of this phenomenon when taking exams at Oxford. He had in his head a standard essay about some general literary topic, and he would find a way to turn the exam question toward it and then just reproduce it again.\n\nStrictly speaking it's the graph of ideas that would be highly connected, not the space, but that usage would confuse people who don't know graph theory, whereas people who do know it will get what I mean if I say \"space\".\n\n[8] Too far doesn't depend just on the distance from the original topic. It's more like that distance divided by the value of whatever I've discovered in the subtree.\n\n[9] Or can you? I should try writing about this. Even if the chance of succeeding is small, the expected value is huge.\n\n[10] There was a vogue in the 20th century for saying that the purpose of art was also to teach. Some artists tried to justify their work by explaining that their goal was not to produce something good, but to challenge our preconceptions about art. And to be fair, art can teach somewhat.

If your product is only half as good as your competitor's, you don't get half as many customers. You get no customers, and you go out of business.\n\nIt's obviously true that the returns for performance are superlinear in business. Some think this is a flaw of capitalism, and that if we changed the rules it would stop being true. But superlinear returns for performance are a feature of the world, not an artifact of rules we've invented. We see the same pattern in fame, power, military victories, knowledge, and even benefit to humanity. In all of these, the rich get richer. [1]\n\nYou can't understand the world without understanding the concept of superlinear returns. And if you're ambitious you definitely should, because this will be the wave you surf on.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt may seem as if there are a lot of different situations with superlinear returns, but as far as I can tell they reduce to two fundamental causes: exponential growth and thresholds.\n\nThe most obvious case of superlinear returns is when you're working on something that grows exponentially. For example, growing bacterial cultures. When they grow at all, they grow exponentially. But they're tricky to grow. Which means the difference in outcome between someone who's adept at it and someone who's not is very great.\n\nStartups can also grow exponentially, and we see the same pattern there. Some manage to achieve high growth rates. Most don't. And as a result you get qualitatively different outcomes: the companies with high growth rates tend to become immensely valuable, while the ones with lower growth rates may not even survive.\n\nY Combinator encourages founders to focus on growth rate rather than absolute numbers. It prevents them from being discouraged early on, when the absolute numbers are still low. It also helps them decide what to focus on: you can use growth rate as a compass to tell you how to evolve the company. But the main advantage is that by focusing on growth rate you tend to get something that grows exponentially.\n\nYC doesn't explicitly tell founders that with growth rate \"you get out what you put in,\" but it's not far from the truth. And if growth rate were proportional to performance, then the reward for performance p over time t would be proportional to pt.\n\nEven after decades of thinking about this, I find that sentence startling.\n\nWhenever how well you do depends on how well you've done, you'll get exponential growth. But neither our DNA nor our customs prepare us for it. No one finds exponential growth natural; every child is surprised, the first time they hear it, by the story of the man who asks the king for a single grain of rice the first day and double the amount each successive day.\n\nWhat we don't understand naturally we develop customs to deal with, but we don't have many customs about exponential growth either, because there have been so few instances of it in human history. In principle herding should have been one: the more animals you had, the more offspring they'd have. But in practice grazing land was the limiting factor, and there was no plan for growing that exponentially.\n\nOr more precisely, no generally applicable plan. There was a way to grow one's territory exponentially: by conquest. The more territory you control, the more powerful your army becomes, and the easier it is to conquer new territory. This is why history is full of empires. But so few people created or ran empires that their experiences didn't affect customs very much. The emperor was a remote and terrifying figure, not a source of lessons one could use in one's own life.\n\nThe most common case of exponential growth in preindustrial times was probably scholarship. The more you know, the easier it is to learn new things. The result, then as now, was that some people were startlingly more knowledgeable than the rest about certain topics. But this didn't affect customs much either. Although empires of ideas can overlap and there can thus be far more emperors, in preindustrial times this type of empire had little practical effect.

But this phenomenon is still so new that we haven't fully assimilated it. Few even of the participants realize they're benefitting from exponential growth or ask what they can learn from other instances of it.\n\nThe other source of superlinear returns is embodied in the expression \"winner take all.\" In a sports match the relationship between performance and return is a step function: the winning team gets one win whether they do much better or just slightly better. [3]\n\nThe source of the step function is not competition per se, however. It's that there are thresholds in the outcome. You don't need competition to get those. There can be thresholds in situations where you're the only participant, like proving a theorem or hitting a target.\n\nIt's remarkable how often a situation with one source of superlinear returns also has the other. Crossing thresholds leads to exponential growth: the winning side in a battle usually suffers less damage, which makes them more likely to win in the future. And exponential growth helps you cross thresholds: in a market with network effects, a company that grows fast enough can shut out potential competitors.\n\nFame is an interesting example of a phenomenon that combines both sources of superlinear returns. Fame grows exponentially because existing fans bring you new ones. But the fundamental reason it's so concentrated is thresholds: there's only so much room on the A-list in the average person's head.\n\nThe most important case combining both sources of superlinear returns may be learning.

Newton did this, and so did Durer and Darwin.\n\n\n\n\n\nAre there general rules for finding situations with superlinear returns? The most obvious one is to seek work that compounds.\n\nThere are two ways work can compound. It can compound directly, in the sense that doing well in one cycle causes you to do better in the next. That happens for example when you're building infrastructure, or growing an audience or brand. Or work can compound by teaching you, since learning compounds. This second case is an interesting one because you may feel you're doing badly as it's happening. You may be failing to achieve your immediate goal. But if you're learning a lot, then you're getting exponential growth nonetheless.\n\nThis is one reason Silicon Valley is so tolerant of failure. People in Silicon Valley aren't blindly tolerant of failure. They'll only continue to bet on you if you're learning from your failures. But if you are, you are in fact a good bet: maybe your company didn't grow the way you wanted, but you yourself have, and that should yield results eventually.\n\nIndeed, the forms of exponential growth that don't consist of learning are so often intermixed with it that we should probably treat this as the rule rather than the exception. Which yields another heuristic: always be learning. If you're not learning, you're probably not on a path that leads to superlinear returns.\n\nBut don't overoptimize what you're learning. Don't limit yourself to learning things that are already known to be valuable. You're learning; you don't know for sure yet what's going to be valuable, and if you're too strict you'll lop off the outliers.\n\nWhat about step functions? Are there also useful heuristics of the form \"seek thresholds\" or \"seek competition?\" Here the situation is trickier. The existence of a threshold doesn't guarantee the game will be worth playing. If you play a round of Russian roulette, you'll be in a situation with a threshold, certainly, but in the best case you're no better off. \"Seek competition\" is similarly useless; what if the prize isn't worth competing for? Sufficiently fast exponential growth guarantees both the shape and magnitude of the return curve \u2014 because something that grows fast enough will grow big even if it's trivially small at first \u2014 but thresholds only guarantee the shape. [4]\n\nA principle for taking advantage of thresholds has to include a test to ensure the game is worth playing. Here's one that does: if you come across something that's mediocre yet still popular, it could be a good idea to replace it. For example, if a company makes a product that people dislike yet still buy, then presumably they'd buy a better alternative if you made one. [5]\n\nIt would be great if there were a way to find promising intellectual thresholds. Is there a way to tell which questions have whole new fields beyond them? I doubt we could ever predict this with certainty, but the prize is so valuable that it would be useful to have predictors that were even a little better than random, and there's hope of finding those. We can to some degree predict when a research problem isn't likely to lead to new discoveries: when it seems legit but boring. Whereas the kind that do lead to new discoveries tend to seem very mystifying, but perhaps unimportant. (If they were mystifying and obviously important, they'd be famous open questions with lots of people already working on them.) So one heuristic here is to be driven by curiosity rather than careerism \u2014 to give free rein to your curiosity instead of working on what you're supposed to.", "start_char_idx": 5798, "end_char_idx": 10210, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "744e6d61-fbd8-4182-9578-3aa9f1f98db7": {"__data__": {"id_": "744e6d61-fbd8-4182-9578-3aa9f1f98db7", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/arnold/Documents/ThesisProject/ERAGS/scripts/../data/knowledge_base/superlinear.txt", "file_name": "superlinear.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 25014, "creation_date": "2024-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "03745557-fd80-4060-b26c-ccb31bab7d82", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/arnold/Documents/ThesisProject/ERAGS/scripts/../data/knowledge_base/superlinear.txt", "file_name": "superlinear.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 25014, "creation_date": "2024-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-11"}, "hash": "1a46655f6cc9cd0671aa1629218a8a7c06118bb3118e66410c60948350497a20", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "2938b220-c978-4f43-b5a0-e7c6130a1c4f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/arnold/Documents/ThesisProject/ERAGS/scripts/../data/knowledge_base/superlinear.txt", "file_name": "superlinear.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 25014, "creation_date": "2024-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-11"}, "hash": "180c348e9ae0e2f8f9255ef53fa41ddf0840a0d2883aab4c1c5f5f76b97e7ad7", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "af9de6e9-8570-4f2e-aa9c-efefa2a34d5c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "74d28f81a9055d92e1aec15a01e8750fe05d300e196e7f1a0a526254ea7d0680", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The prospect of superlinear returns for performance is an exciting one for the ambitious. And there's good news in this department: this territory is expanding in both directions. There are more types of work in which you can get superlinear returns, and the returns themselves are growing.\n\nThere are two reasons for this, though they're so closely intertwined that they're more like one and a half: progress in technology, and the decreasing importance of organizations.\n\nFifty years ago it used to be much more necessary to be part of an organization to work on ambitious projects. It was the only way to get the resources you needed, the only way to have colleagues, and the only way to get distribution. So in 1970 your prestige was in most cases the prestige of the organization you belonged to. And prestige was an accurate predictor, because if you weren't part of an organization, you weren't likely to achieve much. There were a handful of exceptions, most notably artists and writers, who worked alone using inexpensive tools and had their own brands. But even they were at the mercy of organizations for reaching audiences. [6]\n\nA world dominated by organizations damped variation in the returns for performance. But this world has eroded significantly just in my lifetime. Now a lot more people can have the freedom that artists and writers had in the 20th century. There are lots of ambitious projects that don't require much initial funding, and lots of new ways to learn, make money, find colleagues, and reach audiences.\n\nThere's still plenty of the old world left, but the rate of change has been dramatic by historical standards. Especially considering what's at stake. It's hard to imagine a more fundamental change than one in the returns for performance.\n\nWithout the damping effect of institutions, there will be more variation in outcomes. Which doesn't imply everyone will be better off: people who do well will do even better, but those who do badly will do worse. That's an important point to bear in mind. Exposing oneself to superlinear returns is not for everyone. Most people will be better off as part of the pool. So who should shoot for superlinear returns? Ambitious people of two types: those who know they're so good that they'll be net ahead in a world with higher variation, and those, particularly the young, who can afford to risk trying it to find out.

It threatens some vested interests and contradicts some ideologies. [8] But if you're an ambitious individual it's good news for you. How should you take advantage of it?\n\nThe most obvious way to take advantage of superlinear returns for performance is by doing exceptionally good work. At the far end of the curve, incremental effort is a bargain. All the more so because there's less competition at the far end \u2014 and not just for the obvious reason that it's hard to do something exceptionally well, but also because people find the prospect so intimidating that few even try. Which means it's not just a bargain to do exceptional work, but a bargain even to try to.\n\nThere are many variables that affect how good your work is, and if you want to be an outlier you need to get nearly all of them right. For example, to do something exceptionally well, you have to be interested in it. Mere diligence is not enough. So in a world with superlinear returns, it's even more valuable to know what you're interested in, and to find ways to work on it. [9] It will also be important to choose work that suits your circumstances. For example, if there's a kind of work that inherently requires a huge expenditure of time and energy, it will be increasingly valuable to do it when you're young and don't yet have children.\n\nThere's a surprising amount of technique to doing great work. It's not just a matter of trying hard. I'm going to take a shot giving a recipe in one paragraph.\n\nChoose work you have a natural aptitude for and a deep interest in. Develop a habit of working on your own projects; it doesn't matter what they are so long as you find them excitingly ambitious. Work as hard as you can without burning out, and this will eventually bring you to one of the frontiers of knowledge. These look smooth from a distance, but up close they're full of gaps. Notice and explore such gaps, and if you're lucky one will expand into a whole new field. Take as much risk as you can afford; if you're not failing occasionally you're probably being too conservative. Seek out the best colleagues. Develop good taste and learn from the best examples. Be honest, especially with yourself. Exercise and eat and sleep well and avoid the more dangerous drugs. When in doubt, follow your curiosity. It never lies, and it knows more than you do about what's worth paying attention to. [10]\n\nAnd there is of course one other thing you need: to be lucky. Luck is always a factor, but it's even more of a factor when you're working on your own rather than as part of an organization. And though there are some valid aphorisms about luck being where preparedness meets opportunity and so on, there's also a component of true chance that you can't do anything about. The solution is to take multiple shots. Which is another reason to start taking risks early.", "start_char_idx": 12947, "end_char_idx": 15853, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fb09f07f-53b6-4c5f-9a73-4d2b8cd1e53c": {"__data__": {"id_": "fb09f07f-53b6-4c5f-9a73-4d2b8cd1e53c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/arnold/Documents/ThesisProject/ERAGS/scripts/../data/knowledge_base/superlinear.txt", "file_name": "superlinear.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 25014, "creation_date": "2024-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "03745557-fd80-4060-b26c-ccb31bab7d82", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/arnold/Documents/ThesisProject/ERAGS/scripts/../data/knowledge_base/superlinear.txt", "file_name": "superlinear.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 25014, "creation_date": "2024-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-11"}, "hash": "1a46655f6cc9cd0671aa1629218a8a7c06118bb3118e66410c60948350497a20", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "af9de6e9-8570-4f2e-aa9c-efefa2a34d5c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/arnold/Documents/ThesisProject/ERAGS/scripts/../data/knowledge_base/superlinear.txt", "file_name": "superlinear.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 25014, "creation_date": "2024-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-11"}, "hash": "ac292d8d13d8daf85325d4a5d91cec8797bfaa815450f7e638b4207efc4ac64e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "ac16952e-430c-4d7e-92bc-4a48a8294fc4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ef938ac815b902df05663b3ec68a451b6071c55da34d0e88d4f392f234ea71d3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The best example of a field with superlinear returns is probably science. It has exponential growth, in the form of learning, combined with thresholds at the extreme edge of performance \u2014 literally at the limits of knowledge.\n\nThe result has been a level of inequality in scientific discovery that makes the wealth inequality of even the most stratified societies seem mild by comparison. Newton's discoveries were arguably greater than all his contemporaries' combined. [11]\n\nThis point may seem obvious, but it might be just as well to spell it out. Superlinear returns imply inequality. The steeper the return curve, the greater the variation in outcomes.\n\nIn fact, the correlation between superlinear returns and inequality is so strong that it yields another heuristic for finding work of this type: look for fields where a few big winners outperform everyone else. A kind of work where everyone does about the same is unlikely to be one with superlinear returns.\n\nWhat are fields where a few big winners outperform everyone else? Here are some obvious ones: sports, politics, art, music, acting, directing, writing, math, science, starting companies, and investing. In sports the phenomenon is due to externally imposed thresholds; you only need to be a few percent faster to win every race. In politics, power grows much as it did in the days of emperors. And in some of the other fields (including politics) success is driven largely by fame, which has its own source of superlinear growth. But when we exclude sports and politics and the effects of fame, a remarkable pattern emerges: the remaining list is exactly the same as the list of fields where you have to be independent-minded to succeed \u2014 where your ideas have to be not just correct, but novel as well. [12]\n\nThis is obviously the case in science. You can't publish papers saying things that other people have already said. But it's just as true in investing, for example. It's only useful to believe that a company will do well if most other investors don't; if everyone else thinks the company will do well, then its stock price will already reflect that, and there's no room to make money.\n\nWhat else can we learn from these fields? In all of them you have to put in the initial effort. Superlinear returns seem small at first. At this rate, you find yourself thinking, I'll never get anywhere. But because the reward curve rises so steeply at the far end, it's worth taking extraordinary measures to get there.\n\nIn the startup world, the name for this principle is \"do things that don't scale.\" If you pay a ridiculous amount of attention to your tiny initial set of customers, ideally you'll kick off exponential growth by word of mouth. But this same principle applies to anything that grows exponentially. Learning, for example. When you first start learning something, you feel lost. But it's worth making the initial effort to get a toehold, because the more you learn, the easier it will get.\n\nThere's another more subtle lesson in the list of fields with superlinear returns: not to equate work with a job. For most of the 20th century the two were identical for nearly everyone, and as a result we've inherited a custom that equates productivity with having a job. Even now to most people the phrase \"your work\" means their job. But to a writer or artist or scientist it means whatever they're currently studying or creating. For someone like that, their work is something they carry with them from job to job, if they have jobs at all. It may be done for an employer, but it's part of their portfolio.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's an intimidating prospect to enter a field where a few big winners outperform everyone else. Some people do this deliberately, but you don't need to. If you have sufficient natural ability and you follow your curiosity sufficiently far, you'll end up in one. Your curiosity won't let you be interested in boring questions, and interesting questions tend to create fields with superlinear returns if they're not already part of one.\n\nThe territory of superlinear returns is by no means static. Indeed, the most extreme returns come from expanding it. So while both ambition and curiosity can get you into this territory, curiosity may be the more powerful of the two. Ambition tends to make you climb existing peaks, but if you stick close enough to an interesting enough question, it may grow into a mountain beneath you.", "start_char_idx": 15859, "end_char_idx": 20274, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ac16952e-430c-4d7e-92bc-4a48a8294fc4": {"__data__": {"id_": "ac16952e-430c-4d7e-92bc-4a48a8294fc4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/arnold/Documents/ThesisProject/ERAGS/scripts/../data/knowledge_base/superlinear.txt", "file_name": "superlinear.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 25014, "creation_date": "2024-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "03745557-fd80-4060-b26c-ccb31bab7d82", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/arnold/Documents/ThesisProject/ERAGS/scripts/../data/knowledge_base/superlinear.txt", "file_name": "superlinear.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 25014, "creation_date": "2024-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-11"}, "hash": "1a46655f6cc9cd0671aa1629218a8a7c06118bb3118e66410c60948350497a20", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "fb09f07f-53b6-4c5f-9a73-4d2b8cd1e53c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/arnold/Documents/ThesisProject/ERAGS/scripts/../data/knowledge_base/superlinear.txt", "file_name": "superlinear.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 25014, "creation_date": "2024-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-11"}, "hash": "c5ca06b2b5cc3581db0eb12672851262c07b86987f515d82c987af906199b02b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "6c9952f3-8032-43a3-b30c-f19deee25bce", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "e8afe48ea33b86c34401ab3104d3ab6369f874613791fef54c17a53ccc694269", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "It's an intimidating prospect to enter a field where a few big winners outperform everyone else.

What counts as return to one person might be performance to another. But though the borders of these concepts are blurry, they're not meaningless. I've tried to write about them as precisely as I could without crossing into error.\n\n[1] Evolution itself is probably the most pervasive example of superlinear returns for performance. But this is hard for us to empathize with because we're not the recipients; we're the returns.\n\n[2] Knowledge did of course have a practical effect before the Industrial Revolution. The development of agriculture changed human life completely. But this kind of change was the result of broad, gradual improvements in technique, not the discoveries of a few exceptionally learned people.\n\n[3] It's not mathematically correct to describe a step function as superlinear, but a step function starting from zero works like a superlinear function when it describes the reward curve for effort by a rational actor. If it starts at zero then the part before the step is below any linearly increasing return, and the part after the step must be above the necessary return at that point or no one would bother.\n\n[4] Seeking competition could be a good heuristic in the sense that some people find it motivating. It's also somewhat of a guide to promising problems, because it's a sign that other people find them promising. But it's a very imperfect sign: often there's a clamoring crowd chasing some problem, and they all end up being trumped by someone quietly working on another one.\n\n[5] Not always, though. You have to be careful with this rule. When something is popular despite being mediocre, there's often a hidden reason why. Perhaps monopoly or regulation make it hard to compete. Perhaps customers have bad taste or have broken procedures for deciding what to buy. There are huge swathes of mediocre things that exist for such reasons.\n\n[6] In my twenties I wanted to be an artist and even went to art school to study painting. Mostly because I liked art, but a nontrivial part of my motivation came from the fact that artists seemed least at the mercy of organizations.\n\n[7] In principle everyone is getting superlinear returns. Learning compounds, and everyone learns in the course of their life. But in practice few push this kind of everyday learning to the point where the return curve gets really steep.\n\n[8] It's unclear exactly what advocates of \"equity\" mean by it. They seem to disagree among themselves. But whatever they mean is probably at odds with a world in which institutions have less power to control outcomes, and a handful of outliers do much better than everyone else.\n\nIt may seem like bad luck for this concept that it arose at just the moment when the world was shifting in the opposite direction, but I don't think this was a coincidence. I think one reason it arose now is because its adherents feel threatened by rapidly increasing variation in performance.\n\n[9] Corollary: Parents who pressure their kids to work on something prestigious, like medicine, even though they have no interest in it, will be hosing them even more than they have in the past.\n\n[10] The original version of this paragraph was the first draft of \"How to Do Great Work.\" As soon as I wrote it I realized it was a more important topic than superlinear returns, so I paused the present essay to expand this paragraph into its own. Practically nothing remains of the original version, because after I finished \"How to Do Great Work\" I rewrote it based on that.\n\n[11] Before the Industrial Revolution, people who got rich usually did it like emperors: capturing some resource made them more powerful and enabled them to capture more. Now it can be done like a scientist, by discovering or building something uniquely valuable. Most people who get rich use a mix of the old and the new ways, but in the most advanced economies the ratio has shifted dramatically toward discovery just in the last half century.\n\n[12] It's not surprising that conventional-minded people would dislike inequality if independent-mindedness is one of the biggest drivers of it. But it's not simply that they don't want anyone to have what they can't. The conventional-minded literally can't imagine what it's like to have novel ideas. So the whole phenomenon of great variation in performance seems unnatural to them, and when they encounter it they assume it must be due to cheating or to some malign external influence.", "start_char_idx": 19449, "end_char_idx": 24865, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6c9952f3-8032-43a3-b30c-f19deee25bce": {"__data__": {"id_": "6c9952f3-8032-43a3-b30c-f19deee25bce", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/arnold/Documents/ThesisProject/ERAGS/scripts/../data/knowledge_base/superlinear.txt", "file_name": "superlinear.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 25014, "creation_date": "2024-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-11"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "03745557-fd80-4060-b26c-ccb31bab7d82", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/arnold/Documents/ThesisProject/ERAGS/scripts/../data/knowledge_base/superlinear.txt", "file_name": "superlinear.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 25014, "creation_date": "2024-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-11"}, "hash": "1a46655f6cc9cd0671aa1629218a8a7c06118bb3118e66410c60948350497a20", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "ac16952e-430c-4d7e-92bc-4a48a8294fc4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/arnold/Documents/ThesisProject/ERAGS/scripts/../data/knowledge_base/superlinear.txt", "file_name": "superlinear.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 25014, "creation_date": "2024-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-11"}, "hash": "60abc361decbacd5aa6345d012ec82125fd1f53be2bff04cfb72c52685aa5824", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Thanks to Trevor Blackwell, Patrick Collison, Tyler Cowen, Jessica Livingston, Harj Taggar, and Garry Tan for reading drafts of this.", "start_char_idx": 24869, "end_char_idx": 25002, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"2f9e98e0-e8dd-47e9-9f3e-0c27fa5090ed": {"node_ids": ["3df98a0a-9e2d-4c49-aeca-1750164c31d7", "5a44dc1c-f124-423a-80b0-48b3ef96d448", "adb44d1d-294e-43c6-81a5-fd941af495cb", "9dfb7d82-d65d-4f6a-8666-2b12f42747f4", "b3b20b32-9f43-418b-ad81-0c1cebf6c25a", "924af378-8518-409e-a935-5721eeeb1ff9", "bda5f7e3-98b5-48d8-acc4-d48284aa9c65", "73a3f784-9bc7-4b4f-8598-8fb4c747bb3d"], "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/arnold/Documents/ThesisProject/ERAGS/scripts/../data/knowledge_base/best.txt", "file_name": "best.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 24485, "creation_date": "2024-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-11"}}, "03745557-fd80-4060-b26c-ccb31bab7d82": {"node_ids": ["5a1342a1-7f06-441b-a483-bc4732db297e", "133570a6-6473-437c-833b-5ec9347d9ebd", "2938b220-c978-4f43-b5a0-e7c6130a1c4f", "744e6d61-fbd8-4182-9578-3aa9f1f98db7", "af9de6e9-8570-4f2e-aa9c-efefa2a34d5c", "fb09f07f-53b6-4c5f-9a73-4d2b8cd1e53c", "ac16952e-430c-4d7e-92bc-4a48a8294fc4", "6c9952f3-8032-43a3-b30c-f19deee25bce"], "metadata": {"file_path": "/Users/arnold/Documents/ThesisProject/ERAGS/scripts/../data/knowledge_base/superlinear.txt", "file_name": "superlinear.txt", "file_type": "text/plain", "file_size": 25014, "creation_date": "2024-06-11", "last_modified_date": "2024-06-11"}}}}
